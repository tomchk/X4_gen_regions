# X4_gen_regions
This is a WIP Blender addon that generates randomized regions. It is currently based on a sectors.xml file the user selects, and optionally based on an input file briefly listing what types of fields and resources are desired.
Future plans may include porting over more of what I created in XSLT, such as field rings around planets, accretion discs, debris fields, etc.
