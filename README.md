# X4_gen_regions
This is a WIP Blender addon that generates randomized regions. It is currently based on a clusters.xml the user selects, and optionally based on an input file briefly listing what types of fields and resources are desired.
Future plans may include porting over more of what I created in XSLT, such as field rings around planets, accretion disks, debris fields, etc.
